### About the Project
 This is a web-based platform that serves as a centralised hub for all computer science-related information in the college. It provides a comprehensive and inclusive space for students, faculty, and tech chapters to access, share, and collaborate on various computer science-related content. The platform features a feed-like system where chapters can share updates, students can publish technical blogs, and recently published research papers are showcased. By incentivizing users to reach a larger audience, ByteExchange aims to make computer science-related opportunities easily accessible.
